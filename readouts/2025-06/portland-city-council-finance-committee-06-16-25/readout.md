Date: June 16, 2025
Event Type: Finance Committee Hearing
Topic: Temporary Exemption of System Development Charges for Residential Housing

🗣 OPENING STATEMENTS
Chair opened with clear procedural framing: one-hour limit on public comment, followed by Council Q&A.
DCA Donnie Oliveira emphasized this is not a “fix-everything” measure, but a critical lever within the city’s control.

Tone: Focused, urgency-backed, policy-meets-pragmatism.

🧵 MAJOR THEMES & PROCEDURAL FRAMING
Housing production has collapsed: only ~800 market-rate units in 2024.

Pipeline of ~7,300 units stuck pre-permit.

City’s goal: activate 5,000 units in 3 years using SDC exemption.

💰 STRUCTURE OF THE EXEMPTION
Waives SDCs (avg. ~$20K/unit) for new residential construction.

Applies to permits not yet issued by ordinance effective date.

Projects must reach foundation inspection within 12 months of issuance.

Three-year exemption window from effective date.

📉 FISCAL IMPACTS & TRADEOFFS
Modeled lost revenue only includes baseline pipeline units, not new stimulus.

Foregone revenue varies by bureau (e.g., Parks, BES, PBOT).

Inclusionary housing yield expected to rise for 20+ unit projects.

🏗 TARGET PROJECT TYPES
Sweet spot: 4–200 unit wood-frame rentals and middle housing.

Luxury or steel-concrete projects unlikely to pencil even with exemption.

Office-to-housing conversions included if unit-generating.

🧩 ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM
No refunding of already-paid SDCs.

Must break ground (foundation inspection) within 12 months.

Alternative compliance path: lender construction agreement.

🤝 EMERGING CONSENSUS ITEMS
Broad support for unlocking “shovel-sitting” pipeline.

Exemption seen as efficient compared to direct subsidy.

Supports Portland’s narrative recovery and capital attraction.

⚠️ POINTS OF CONTENTION OR AMBIGUITY
Loophole concerns: token residential in large commercial projects.

Some trade-offs for regulated ownership units (waiver > restriction).

Limited tools to prevent speculative filing without intent to build.

🎤 PUBLIC TESTIMONY THEMES
Consistent message: “this is the difference between go/no-go.”

Multiple developers confirmed projects (hundreds of units) hinge on passage.

Capital market interest already re-activated since proposal announcement.

📡 SIGNAL WATCH
SDC relief is seen as a signal, not just a subsidy.

Several developers pledged unit counts (e.g., Seneca: 500 units).

“Portland is open for business again” echoed repeatedly.

🔍 WHAT DID WE LEARN TODAY?
Developers are not waiting—they’re stalled.

This exemption is timely, targeted, and likely to yield.

Risk of overpromising is low relative to stagnation costs.

🔄 WHAT CHANGED TODAY?
Council heard broad, aligned private-sector support.

Trust-building mechanisms (e.g., construction deadline) surfaced clearly.

Effective date and administrative rulemaking emerged as near-term decisions.

⚖️ LEGAL & POLICY ANCHORS
Ordinance modifies Title 17.

Effective date default: October 1, 2025 (Council may override).

Policy goal: 5,000 units exempted within 3 years.
